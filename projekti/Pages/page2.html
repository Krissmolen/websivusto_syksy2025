            </h2>

            <p class="lead-text">
               Alphonse Mucha’s Le Pater (1899) is often considered the artist’s spiritual masterpiece- 
               a deeply symbolic and mystical work that stands apart from his more commercial Art Nouveau posters. 
               Created at a turning point in his life, Le Pater was Mucha’s personal exploration of faith, human struggle, and divine guidance. 
               At his own request, only 510 copies were ever printed, making it one of the rarest and most sought-after pieces in his entire oeuvre. 
               The book presents a series of intricate illustrations and luminous plates, each one inspired by and corresponding to a specific line of the “Our Father” prayer. 
               Through this structure, Mucha transforms a familiar Christian text into a universal meditation on hope, morality, and the path toward spiritual enlightenment.
               A lot of symbols and characters still give off the same stories as told in the "Where do we come from" by Ernst Muldashev

                                         above the people, her chest adorned with multiple breasts from which streams of milk pour downward like sacred rivers.
                                          Below, men, women, and children kneel on the ground, drinking the falling milk as though receiving life directly from a 
                                          divine source. Above this scene floats a luminous woman in white, almost angelic, her body glowing as she holds something
                                           sacred to her chest - a symbol of spiritual nourishment watching over the physical one. The entire image blends the primal 
                                           and the holy: earthly hunger fed by a mythic mother, while a heavenly guardian hovers above, reminding the viewer that 
                                           sustenance is both a physical need and a spiritual gift.</div>

                                         rises at the center of the scene, both arms lifted upward as if calling down judgment or mercy from above. His presence
                                          is immense — radiant, commanding, impossible to ignore. At his feet stand smaller human figures: one man looks up at the 
                                          angel with a mixture of fear and pleading, as though begging for forgiveness or understanding. Clinging tightly to this man’s 
                                          legs is another figure, half-hidden, curling into himself in terror — a childlike, frightened soul seeking safety from the
                                           overwhelming divine presence. The contrast is sharp: the angel’s vast, upright form radiates cosmic power, while the humans
                                            below reveal the trembling vulnerability of guilt, fear, and hope. (See last plate below)</div>

            <p class="lead-text"> <strong>"Lead us not into temptation, But deliver us from evil. Amen" Last Plate </strong> <br> A central figure stands with eyes closed, calm and vulnerable at the same time -
                 as if surrendering themselves fully to trust. Just behind them hovers a holy, luminous being, almost like a guardian spirit. This protective presence
                  leans gently forward, wrapping the central figure in a shield of light. Behind them both, shadowy creatures and twisted forms lurk in the darkness -
                   the embodiments of temptation and hidden dangers. Their shapes reach forward but stop just short, unable to cross the invisible barrier created by
                    the guardian’s light. The whole scene feels like a moment of quiet spiritual rescue a human soul standing still, eyes closed, while an unseen divine protector keeps the darkness at bay.</p>
